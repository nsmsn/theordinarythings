As a youngster Andrew got a healthy dose of 94 Rock (Albuquerque’s rock station), and fell in love with the classic rock and hard rock genres heard on that station. In high school when he started to discover music for himself, he was drawn to the instrumentals that the hip hop producers of the 90s had created. Each seemed to have their own creative style and way of doing things. He started to notice that they weren’t really following any rules other than “as long as it sounds good”. In interviews they showed a sense of joy when talking about the process of creating something from nothing. This idea stuck with Andrew and gave him a greater appreciation for music as a fan. Andrew never thought he would be creating music with a band and for people to hear, but he has taken off as a musician in The Ordinary Things.
