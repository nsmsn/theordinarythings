Jackie grew up in a musical family and was surrounded from an early age. She started taking piano lessons at age five and played for several years until she decided drumming was her passion. She started lessons, joined band at school, and never looked back. Her parents wanted to know how serious she was about this and she did yard work and chores for months to save up for her first drum kit. She studied percussion for two years at Northern Arizona University and then switched majors to become a speech pathologist. Jackie returned to Albuquerque and has since played with bands such as Jimmy Deveney and The Lamplighters, Dust City Opera, Cactus Tractor, and Eileen & The In-Betweens. The Ordinary Things has been her biggest creative project and she is honored to have such fine musicians and humans by her side on this&nbsp;journey.
